# harajuku oniichan

it's year 3439 and neotokyo is being attacked by flesh-eating cows from mercury

only one person can stop them, the hypermasculine hero called HARAJUKU ONIICHAN

this is a very small thing and very dumb, there is no win state also, but you can go for a high score and post it in the comments

i am still refactoring my JS game library and i wanted to do something that would be "closer to a game" and slightly bigger than "feeding neko-tan", to see where i can improve things. in the end i ended up almost not touching the library and 95% of the work here went into horrible throwaway code for the game itself, but that's ok i guess

next time i'll do maybe a platformer or a dungeon crawler who knows
